2.	We’re going to create the game users have to guess words based on a letter bank. There will be a crossword puzzle
display for the user so that they can guess the corresponding words. There will be approximate 5 levels. Each level has a 
different theme to make things more exciting and appealing for the users.  
3.	The goal is to make a single player game, to create words using a letter bank, and to pass the time while 
stimulating the user’s brain. 
4.	We’re going to use GNU standard library, G++ compiler, GitHub, and Git.
5.	We will be using functions from the G++ standard library and G++ compiler to create a game from scratch. 
We will be using GitHub and Git to record our work as we go. 
6.	Our project will be made from scratch therefore all features will be new.
